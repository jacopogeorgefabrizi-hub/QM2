What column *should* you merge on in city_pop? Which column should you merge on in city_c?\n","\n","The syntax for merging on a **column** (which is not the index) is to pass the column name to the optional 'left_on=' or 'right_on=' arguments. And we don't use right_index=True (or left_index=True), depending on which we're using.\n","\n","So for example: **df1.merge(df2, left_on='Name', right_index=True)** would join df1 (on the left) to df2 (on the right), using the column 'Name' on the left (df1) and the index column (whatever that is) on the right (df2)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hbQwHwaSS6jH","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"outputId":"554a16fe-046b-4b4b-d9ae-c43b35b81df5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                              Country or Area\n","City                                         \n","MARIEHAMN                      íland Islands\n","Bahí_a Blanca-Cerri                 Argentina\n","BUENOS AIRES                        Argentina\n","Catamarca                           Argentina\n","Comodoro Rivadavia-Rada Tilly       Argentina\n","...                                       ...\n","Bulawayo                             Zimbabwe\n","Chitungwiza                          Zimbabwe\n","Gweru                                Zimbabwe\n","HARARE                               Zimbabwe\n","Mutare                               Zimbabwe\n","\n","[1230 rows x 1 columns]"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-2dff2269-300b-409a-bd49-24fb16c015bc\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Country or Area</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>City</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>MARIEHAMN</th>\n","      <td>íland Islands</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Bahí_a Blanca-Cerri</th>\n","      <td>Argentina</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>BUENOS AIRES</th>\n","      <td>Argentina</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Catamarca</th>\n","      <td>Argentina</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Comodoro Rivadavia-Rada Tilly</th>\n","      <td>Argentina</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Bulawayo</th>\n","      <td>Zimbabwe</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Chitungwiza</th>\n","      <td>Zimbabwe</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Gweru</th>\n","      <td>Zimbabwe</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>HARARE</th>\n","      <td>Zimbabwe</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mutare</th>\n","      <td>Zimbabwe</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>1230 rows × 1 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-2dff2269-300b-409a-bd49-24fb16c015bc')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-2dff2269-300b-409a-bd49-24fb16c015bc button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
